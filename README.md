# Restaurant-Health-Inspection-Score-Prediction
## What problem are we trying to solve?
Health inspectors currently pick restaurants to inspect randomly. Using ML, we can predict restaurants most at risk for failing a health inspection. Once these predictions have been made, Austin Department of Public Health staff can use these predictions to prioritize inspections. 

## Who will benefit (directly and indirectly) from this project?
Austin Community will be more assured that the food they eat at any restaurant is safe. Restaurant owners will benefit because this system could also be used as a warning/forecasting system. City health inspectors will save time by focusing on only the most at risk restaurants, and can spend more time on other issues if neccesary.
